# Advent of Code 2022

**SPOILER ALERT**: Answers are shown down below in the **Answers** section so please avoid that section if you're wary to that sort of thing.

- I'll be doing my best to keep up with the daily challenges, but I may fall behind by a day or two depending on how busy the holidays get.
- My solutions are biased towards readability, Rust idioms, best-case time-complexity, and minimizing allocations. Low-level tricks for optimal performance eschewed.
- Each problem comes with its own unit test using their respective example input (as opposed to the actual input).
- No effort is made to share utilities between problems, that includes the parts of each day.
- If you have suggestions on how I could have done something better please open up an issue!

## Solutions

- [Day 1, part 2](src/i/part_two.rs)
- [Day 2, part 1](src/ii/part_one.rs)
- [Day 2, part 2](src/ii/part_two.rs)
- [Day 3, part 1](src/iii/part_one.rs)
- [Day 3, part 2](src/iii/part_two.rs)
- [Day 4, part 1](src/iv/part_one.rs)
- [Day 4, part 2](src/iv/part_two.rs)
- [Day 5, part 1](src/v/part_one.rs)
- [Day 5, part 2](src/v/part_two.rs)
